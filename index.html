        population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018, in an area of more than
        105 square kilometres (<small> square miles</small> ).<sup>[4]</sup>
        Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of
        finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts.
        The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and
        province of Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated
        population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of
        France as of 2017.<sup>[5]</sup> The Paris Region had a GDP of €709
        billion ( <abbr>$808 billion</abbr>) in 2017.<sup>[6]</sup> According to
        the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018,
        Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore
        and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.<sup>[7]</sup> Another
        source ranked Paris as most expensive, on par with Singapore and Hong
        Kong, in 2018.<sup>[8][9]</sup>

        Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks:
        the Louvre remained the most-visited museum in the world with 2,677,504
        visitors in 2020, despite the long museum closings caused by the
        COVID-19 virus.<sup>[14]</sup>
        The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are
        noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou
        Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern
        and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso
        exhibit the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along
        the Seine in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site; popular landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de
        Paris on the Île de la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15
        April 2019 fire. Other popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal
        chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower,
        constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais
        and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the
        Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with
        its artistic history and its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur.

        <h3 id="one">Etymology</h3>
        <p style="padding: 10px">
          &emsp; &emsp; The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city
          of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius
          Caesar as Luteciam Parisiorum ('Lutetia of the Parisii'), and is later
          attested as Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265.
          During the Roman period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia
          in Latin, and as Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either
          stemming from the Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto-
          ('marsh, swamp'), depending on whether the Latin or Greek form is the
          closest to the original Gaulish name
        </p>
        <p>
          The name Paris is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii
          (Gaulish: Parisioi), a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman
          period. The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According
          to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root pario-
          ('cauldron'). Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or
          'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh peryff ('lord,
          commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form
          reconstructed as *kwar-is-io-. Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert
          proposed to translate Parisii as the 'spear people', by connecting the
          first element to the Old Irish carr ('spear'), derived from an earlier
          *kwar-sā. In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of
          Greek mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paris is often referred to as the 'City of Light' (La Ville Lumière),
          both because of its leading role during the Age of Enlightenment and
          more literally because Paris was one of the first large European
          cities to use gas street lighting on a grand scale on its boulevards
          and monuments. Gas lights were installed on the Place du Carrousel,
          Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By 1857, the Grand boulevards
          were lit. By the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were
          illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps. Since the late 19th century, Paris
          has also been known as Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.

        <p style="padding: 10px">
          &emsp; &emsp; The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones,
          inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC
          One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on
          the île de la Cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes
          gradually became an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with
          many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and
          minted their own coins for that purpose.
        </p>

          Clovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the
          city his capital from 508. As the Frankish domination of Gaul began,
          there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the
          Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la
          Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris' strategic
          importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was
          established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for
          which the then Count of Paris (comte de Paris), Odo of France, was
          elected king of West Francia. From the Capetian dynasty that began
          with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the
          Franks (duc des Francs), as king of a unified Francia, Paris gradually
          became the largest and most prosperous city in France.

          By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political,
          economic, religious, and cultural capital of France. The Palais de la
          Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île
          de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully,
          bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame
          Cathedral at its eastern extremity.

        <h3 id="three">Culture</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp; &emsp;For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around
          the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek
          inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As
          a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art".
          Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in
          Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and
          reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French
          monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian
          artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and
          Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou
          acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in
          17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King
          Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale de peinture
          et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was
          established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the
          capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.

          The inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph
          on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death
          of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the
          most common form of photography until the 1860s. The work of
          Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the
          development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a
          central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray
          and Maurice Tabard. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their
          photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions
          of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of
          people and market scenes (among which Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville
          has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis,
          noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri
          Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Poster art also became an
          important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through
          the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset,
          Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel
          Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.

          he largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier
          (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends
          toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a
          mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In middle of the 19th century,
          there were three other active and competing opera houses: the
          Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre
          Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre
          de la Ville). Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall
          of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the
          Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of
          Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.

          &emsp; &emsp; Paris is the département with the highest proportion of
          highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a
          licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,
          while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in
          France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs
          approximately 310,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and
          professors teaching approximately 2.9 million children and students in

          The Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the grandes
          écoles – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside
          the public university structure. The prestigious public universities
          are usually considered grands établissements. Most of the grandes
          écoles were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s,
          in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded
          City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has
          remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.There are a high
          number of engineering schools, led by the PSL University (which
          comprises several colleges such as École des Mines, École nationale
          supérieure de chimie, École Pratique des Hautes Études and
          Paris-Dauphine), the Paris-Saclay University (which comprises several
          colleges such as AgroParisTech, CentraleSupélec and ENS Paris-Saclay)
          the Polytechnic Institute of Paris (which comprises several colleges
          such as École Polytechnique, Télécom Paris and École nationale de la
          statistique et de l'administration économique) and also independent
          colleges such as École des Ponts et Chaussées or Arts et Métiers.
          There are also many business schools, including HEC, INSEAD, ESSEC,
          and ESCP Europe. The administrative school such as ENA has been
          relocated to Strasbourg, the political science school Sciences-Po is
          still located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, the most prestigious
          university for social sciences, the École des hautes études en
          sciences sociales is located in Paris' 6th arrondissement and the most
          prestigious university of economics and finance, Paris-Dauphine, is
          located in Paris' 16th. The Parisian school of journalism CELSA
          department of Sorbonne University is located in Neuilly-sur-Seine.
          Paris is also home to several of France's most famous high-schools
          such as Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Lycée Henri-IV, Lycée Janson de Sailly
          and Lycée Condorcet. The National Institute of Sport and Physical
          Education, located in the 12th arrondissement, is both a physical
          education institute and high-level training centre for elite athletes.
