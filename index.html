      &emsp; &emsp; <b>Paris</b> (<small
        >French pronunciation: ​[paʁi]
        <cite>(About this soundlisten)</cite></small
      >) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated
      population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018, in an area of more than 105
      square kilometres (<small> square miles</small> ).<sup>[4]</sup> Since the
      17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance,
      diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. The City of
      Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of
      Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of
      12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of
      2017.<sup>[5]</sup> The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion (
      <abbr>$808 billion</abbr>) in 2017.<sup>[6]</sup> According to the
      Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris
      was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore and ahead
      of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.<sup>[7]</sup> Another source
      ranked Paris as most expensive, on par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in
      2018.<sup>[8][9]</sup>

      Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the
      Louvre remained the most-visited museum in the world with 2,677,504
      visitors in 2020, despite the long museum closings caused by the COVID-19
      virus.<sup>[14]</sup>
      The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are
      noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou
      Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern
      and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit
      the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine
      in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; popular
      landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de
      la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other
      popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle,
      also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris
      Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for
      the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the
      Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and
      its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur.
