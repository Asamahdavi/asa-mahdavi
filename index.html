      population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018, in an area of more than 105
      square kilometres (<small> square miles</small> ).<sup>[4]</sup> Since the
      17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance,
      diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science, and arts. The City of
      Paris is the centre and seat of government of the region and province of
      Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of
      12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of
      2017.<sup>[5]</sup> The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion (
      <abbr>$808 billion</abbr>) in 2017.<sup>[6]</sup> According to the
      Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris
      was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore and ahead
      of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo, and Geneva.<sup>[7]</sup> Another source
      ranked Paris as most expensive, on par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in
      2018.<sup>[8][9]</sup>

      Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the
      Louvre remained the most-visited museum in the world with 2,677,504
      visitors in 2020, despite the long museum closings caused by the COVID-19
      virus.<sup>[14]</sup>
      The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are
      noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou
      Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern
      and contemporary art in Europe. The Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso exhibit
      the works of two noted Parisians. The historical district along the Seine
      in the city centre is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; popular
      landmarks there include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris on the Île de
      la Cité, now closed for renovation after the 15 April 2019 fire. Other
      popular tourist sites include the Gothic royal chapel of Sainte-Chapelle,
      also on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel Tower, constructed for the Paris
      Universal Exposition of 1889; the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for
      the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the
      Champs-Élysées, and the hill of Montmartre with its artistic history and
      its Basilica of Sacré-Coeur.

    <h3 id="one">Etymology</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; &emsp; The ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of
      Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as
      Luteciam Parisiorum ('Lutetia of the Parisii'), and is later attested as
      Parision in the 5th century AD, then as Paris in 1265. During the Roman
      period, it was commonly known as Lutetia or Lutecia in Latin, and as
      Leukotekía in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the
      Celtic root *lukot- ('mouse'), or from *luto- ('marsh, swamp'), depending
      on whether the Latin or Greek form is the closest to the original Gaulish
      name
    </p>
    <h3 id="two">History</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; &emsp; The Parisii, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited
      the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC One of the
      area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la
      Cité; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became
      an important trading centre. The Parisii traded with many river towns
      (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins for
      that purpose.
    </p>
    <h3 id="three">Culture</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; &emsp;For centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the
      world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek
      inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a
      result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the "City of Art". Italian
      artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in
      the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs.
      Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the
      French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their
      palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as
      Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists
      in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first
      painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the Académie royale
      de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was
      established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the
      capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.

    <h3 id="four">Education</h3>
    <p>
      &emsp; &emsp; Paris is the département with the highest proportion of
      highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a
      licence-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France, while
      13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France.
      Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately
      330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching
      approximately 2.9 million children and students in around 9,000 primary,
      secondary, and higher education schools and institutions
